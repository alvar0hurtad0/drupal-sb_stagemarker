# Stage Marker

*This is a left aside module that wants to be released.*

Write marks to watchdog or devel's query log at the beginning and end of each run stage of page execution.

## TODO

 * Branch d6/d7
 * Find the other versions I have of this module and push updates
 * Find a nice name ('instrument'?)
 * Publish to drupal.org
